# .NET-E-commerce-Website
This is my first E-commerce website in .NET.
Why did I make an E-commerce website?
My goal was learning .NET MVC logic.When I made this website, I always searched how to made of e-commerce website from zero.
I learned shopping cart logic and developing front-end.At the same time, I learned what processes the e-commerce site is doing in the background.
If you want, you can take a look my codes and screenshots in website.
